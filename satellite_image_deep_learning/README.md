# State of the art
What are companies doing?
* Overall trend to using AWS S3 backend for image storage. There are a variety of tools for exploring and having teams collaborate on data on S3, e.g. [T4](https://github.com/quiltdata/t4).
* Bucking the trend, [Descartes & Airbus are using a google backend](https://spacenews.com/descartes-labs-platform-adds-airbus-imagery/) -> checkout [gcsts for google cloud storage sile-system](https://github.com/dask/gcsfs)
* Just speculating, but a [serverless pipeline](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-rekognition-video-analyzer) appears to be where companies are headed for routine compute tasks, whilst providing a Jupyter notebook approach for custom analysis.
* Traditional data formats aren't designed for processing, so new standards are developing such as [cloud optimised geotiffs](http://blog.digitalglobe.com/developers/cloud-optimized-geotiffs-and-the-path-to-accessible-satellite-imagery-analytics/) and [zarr](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr)

# Online platforms for Geo analysis
* [This article discusses some of the available platforms](https://medium.com/pangeo/cloud-native-geoprocessing-of-earth-observation-satellite-data-with-pangeo-997692d91ca2) -> TLDR Pangeo rocks, but must BYO imagery
* Pangeo - open source resources for parallel processing using Dask and Xarray http://pangeo.io/index.html
* [Airbus Sandbox](https://sandbox.intelligence-airbusds.com/web/) -> will provide access to imagery
* [Descartes Labs](https://www.descarteslabs.com/) -> access to EO imagery from a variety of providers via python API -> not clear which imagery is available (Airbus + others?) or pricing
* DigitalGlobe have a cloud hosted Jupyter notebook platform called [GBDX](https://platform.digitalglobe.com/gbdx/). Cloud hosting means they can guarantee the infrastructure supports their algorithms, and they appear to be close/closer to deploying DL. [Tutorial notebooks here](https://notebooks.geobigdata.io/hub/tutorials/list). Only Sentinel-2 and Landsat data on free tier.
* Planet have a [Jupyter notebook platform](https://developers.planet.com/) which can be deployed locally and requires an [API key](https://developers.planet.com/docs/quickstart/getting-started/) (14 days free). They have a python wrapper (2.7..) to their rest API. No price after 14 day trial.


# Techniques
This section explores the different techniques (DL, ML & classical) people are applying to common problems in satellite imagery analysis. Classification problems are the most simply addressed via DL, object detection is harder, and cloud detection harder still (niche interest).

## Land classification
* Very common problem, assign land classification to a pixel based on pixel value, can be addressed via [simple sklearn cluster algorithm](https://github.com/acgeospatial/Satellite_Imagery_Python/blob/master/Clustering_KMeans-Sentinel2.ipynb) or [deep learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/land-use-land-cover-classification-with-deep-learning-9a5041095ddb).
* Land use is related to classification, but we are trying to detect a scene, e.g. housing, forestry. I have tried CNN -> [See my notebooks](https://github.com/robmarkcole/satellite-image-deep-learning/tree/master/land_classification)
* [Land Use Classification using Convolutional Neural Network in Keras](https://github.com/tavgreen/landuse_classification)
* [Sea-Land segmentation using DL](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.00201.pdf)
* [Pixel level segmentation on Azure](https://github.com/Azure/pixel_level_land_classification)
* [Deep Learning-Based Classification of Hyperspectral Data](https://github.com/hantek/deeplearn_hsi)
* [A U-net based on Tensorflow for objection detection (or segmentation) of satellite images - DSTL dataset but python 2.7](https://github.com/rogerxujiang/dstl_unet)

## Semantic segmentation
* Pixel-wise classification
* [Instance segmentation with keras - links to satellite examples](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN)


## Change detection
* Monitor water levels, coast lines, size of urban areas, wildfire damage. Note, clouds change often too..!
* Using PCA (python 2, requires updating) -> https://appliedmachinelearning.blog/2017/11/25/unsupervised-changed-detection-in-multi-temporal-satellite-images-using-pca-k-means-python-code/
* Using CNN -> https://github.com/vbhavank/Unstructured-change-detection-using-CNN

* [PySAR - InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) timeseries analysis in python](https://github.com/hfattahi/PySAR)

## Image registration
* [Wikipedia article on registration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_registration) -> register for change detection or [image stitching](https://mono.software/2018/03/14/Image-stitching/)
* Traditional approach -> define control points, employ RANSAC algorithm
* [Phase correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_correlation) used to estimate the translation between two images with sub-pixel accuracy, useful for [allows accurate registration of low resolution imagery onto high resolution imagery](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118724194.ch11), or register a [sub-image on a full image](https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/registering-an-image-using-normalized-cross-correlation.html) -> Unlike many spatial-domain algorithms, the phase correlation method is resilient to noise, occlusions, and other defects. [Applied to Landsat images here](https://github.com/JamieTurrin/Phase-Correlation).

## Object detection
* A typical task is detecting boats on the ocean, which should be simpler than land based challenges owing to blank background in images, but is still challenging and no convincing robust solutions available.
* Intro articles [here](https://medium.com/earthcube-stories/how-hard-it-is-for-an-ai-to-detect-ships-on-satellite-images-7265e34aadf0) and [here](https://medium.com/the-downlinq/object-detection-in-satellite-imagery-a-low-overhead-approach-part-i-cbd96154a1b7).
* [DigitalGlobe article](http://gbdxstories.digitalglobe.com/boats/) - they use a combination classical techniques (masks, erodes) to reduce the search space (identifying water via [NDWI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_difference_water_index) which requires SWIR) then apply a binary DL classifier on candidate regions of interest. They deploy the final algo [as a task](https://github.com/platformstories/boat-detector) on their GBDX platform. They propose that in the future an R-CNN may be suitable for the whole process.

* [Find sports fields using Mask R-CNN and overlay on open-street-map](https://github.com/jremillard/images-to-osm)


## Cloud detection
* A subset of the object detection problem, but surprisingly challenging
* From [this article on sentinelhub](https://medium.com/sentinel-hub/improving-cloud-detection-with-machine-learning-c09dc5d7cf13) there are three popular classical algorithms that detects thresholds in multiple bands in order to identify clouds. In the same article they propose using semantic segmentation combined with a CNN for a cloud classifier (excellent review paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.06857.pdf)), but state that this requires too much compute resources.
* [This article](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/8/8/666) compares a number of ML algorithms, random forests, stochastic gradient descent, support vector machines, Bayesian method.
* DL..

Several algorithms described [in the ArcGIS docs](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/raster-and-images/fundamentals-of-panchromatic-sharpening.htm), with the simplest being taking the mean of the pan and RGB pixel value.
* Does not require DL, classical algos suffice, [see this notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/HyperionAnalytics/PyDataNYC2014/blob/master/panchromatic_sharpening.ipynb) and [this kaggle kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/resolut/panchromatic-sharpening)

* Simple band math `ndvi = np.true_divide((ir - r), (ir + r))` but challenging due to the size of the imagery.
* [Example notebook local](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/HyperionAnalytics/PyDataNYC2014/blob/master/ndvi_calculation.ipynb)

## SAR
* [Removing speckle noise from Sentinel-1 SAR using a CNN](https://medium.com/upstream/denoising-sentinel-1-radar-images-5f764faffb3e)
* A dataset which is specifically made for deep learning on SAR and optical imagery is the SEN1-2 dataset, which contains around 250K corresponding patch pairs of Sentinel 1 (VV) and 2 (RGB) data. [Data download](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1436631), [Paper](https://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/IV-1/141/2018/isprs-annals-IV-1-141-2018.pdf)
